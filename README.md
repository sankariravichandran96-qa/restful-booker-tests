## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** — [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Java 11+** — required by Allure CLI to generate and open reports

### Installing Java

**Windows:**
1. Download the installer from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/) (Eclipse Temurin — free, LTS)
2. Run the installer and check **"Set JAVA_HOME variable"** and **"Add to PATH"** during setup
3. Open a new terminal and verify:
```bash
java --version
```
You should see output like `openjdk 17.x.x` or similar.

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install openjdk@17
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jre
```

### Installing Allure CLI

Allure is bundled as an npm package — no separate installer needed. It is installed automatically when you run `npm install`. Verify it works after installation:

```bash
npx allure --version
```

You should see a version number such as `2.40.0`. If you see an error, Java is not on your PATH — revisit the Java installation step above.

---

## Installation

### 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd restful-booker-tests
```

### 2 — Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs Playwright, TypeScript, Allure, and all other dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### 3 — Install Playwright browsers (required for UI tests)

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

### 4 — Verify the full setup

Run all four checks before running tests:

```bash
node --version       # should be 18 or higher
npm --version        # any recent version
java --version       # should be 11 or higher
npx allure --version # should show 2.x.x
```

---

## Running Tests

### API Tests (Task 2)

```bash
# Run all API tests
npm run test:api

# Run and open Allure report
npm run test:api:allure
```

### UI Tests (Task 3)

```bash
# Run headless (default)
npm run test:ui

# Run in browser (visible)
npm run test:ui:headed

# Run and open Allure report
npm run test:ui:allure
```

### Unit Tests — BookingClient (Task 2, optional)

The `BookingClient` wrapper is covered by unit tests using **Jest** with mocked HTTP
responses — no real network calls are made.

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

> **Note:** Unit tests run locally only. They are intentionally excluded from the CI
> pipeline to keep the pipeline focused on integration and E2E tests against the live
> environments. This is a deliberate SDET decision — unit tests validate the wrapper
> logic in isolation; integration tests validate the real API behaviour.

---

## Reports

### Playwright HTML Report

Generated after every run at `playwright-report/index.html`.

```bash
npm run report:html
```

### Allure Report

Richer report with epics, features, severity, and step-level details.

```bash
npm run report:allure
```

Or generate and open manually:

```bash
npx allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
npx allure open allure-report
```

The Allure report includes:
- **Overview** — pass/fail summary
- **Behaviours** — tests grouped by Epic → Feature → Story hierarchy
- **Suites** — tests grouped by file
- **Timeline** — execution timing
- **Graphs** — severity and status breakdowns

---

## Environment Configuration

Tests use sensible defaults and can be overridden via environment variables — no code changes needed.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE_URL` | `https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com` | API base URL |
| `BOOKER_USERNAME` | `admin` | API auth username |
| `BOOKER_PASSWORD` | `password123` | API auth password |
| `UI_BASE_URL` | `https://www.medirect.com.mt` | UI base URL |

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
BASE_URL=https://staging.example.com npm run test:api
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:BASE_URL="https://staging.example.com"; npm run test:api
```

All values are centralised in `src/Common/config.ts` — no magic strings in tests or page objects.

---

## Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run test:api` | Run all API tests |
| `npm run test:api:allure` | Run API tests + open Allure report |
| `npm run test:unit` | Run BookingClient unit tests (Jest, local only) |
| `npm run test:ui` | Run all UI tests (headless) |
| `npm run test:ui:headed` | Run UI tests in visible browser |
| `npm run test:ui:allure` | Run UI tests + open Allure report |
| `npm run report:html` | Open Playwright HTML report |
| `npm run report:allure` | Generate and open Allure report |
| `npm run clean` | Delete all generated report and result folders |

---

## Test Coverage

### API Tests — Restful Booker (Task 2)

| File | Tests | What is covered |
|---|---|---|
| `auth.spec.ts` | 2 | Health check (ping), valid credentials return a token |
| `booking.crud.spec.ts` | 7 | Create → Get → List → PUT → PATCH → Delete → Confirm deleted |
| `booking.negative.spec.ts` | 3 | Non-existent ID (404), unauthorised delete (403), malformed payload (500) |

The CRUD tests run in a single chained describe block using `beforeAll` to create one shared booking — mirroring the Postman collection runner approach from Task 1.

### Unit Tests — BookingClient (Task 2, optional)

| File | Tests | What is covered |
|---|---|---|
| `bookingClient.unit.spec.ts` | 5+ | BookingClient methods tested in isolation using Jest mocks — no real HTTP calls made |

Unit tests mock the `APIRequestContext` to verify that `BookingClient` constructs requests
correctly (correct URLs, headers, token injection) without hitting the live API.

### UI Tests — MeDirect Equities (Task 3)

| File | Tests | What is covered |
|---|---|---|
| `navigation.spec.ts` | 4 | Default equities tab load + row count; Funds, ETFs, Bonds tab navigation |
| `search.spec.ts` | 3 | Search returns results; More Information navigates to detail page; non-existent search returns empty list |
| `securityDetails.spec.ts` | 4 | Registration banner visible; Overview fields locked; Bottom CTA + sign-up text visible; Price locked behind lock icon |

---

## CI/CD Pipeline (Task 4)

The test framework is fully integrated into a GitHub Actions pipeline defined in
`.github/workflows/tests.yml`.

### Pipeline Overview

```
Push / PR / Schedule / Manual
           │
     ┌─────┴──────┐
     ▼            ▼
 api-tests     ui-tests        ← Run in parallel
     │            │
     └─────┬──────┘
           ▼
   publish-allure              ← Publishes Allure report to GitHub Pages
           │
           ▼
        notify                 ← Sends HTML email summary (schedule & failures)
```

### Triggers

| Trigger | When |
|---|---|
| `push` | Every commit pushed to `main` |
| `pull_request` | Every PR opened or updated against `main` |
| `schedule` | Every day at **08:00 UTC** automatically |
| `workflow_dispatch` | On-demand manual run from the GitHub Actions tab |

### Jobs

| Job | What it does |
|---|---|
| **API Integration Tests** | Runs all 12 API tests (auth, CRUD, negative) against the Restful Booker API |
| **UI End-to-End Tests** | Runs all 11 UI tests (navigation, search, security details) against the MeDirect site |
| **Publish Allure Report** | Downloads both Allure reports and deploys them to GitHub Pages |
| **Email Test Summary** | Parses results JSON and sends an HTML email with pass/fail counts |

> **Note — Unit tests are excluded from CI intentionally.** The `bookingClient.unit.spec.ts`
> Jest unit tests run locally only (`npm run test:unit`). The CI pipeline is deliberately
> kept focused on integration and E2E tests that validate real API and browser behaviour.
> Unit tests validate the `BookingClient` wrapper in isolation and do not require a
> pipeline environment to run.

### Artifacts

Every run uploads the following artifacts (retained for 30 days):

- `api-playwright-html-report` — Playwright HTML report for API tests
- `api-allure-report` — Allure report for API tests
- `ui-playwright-html-report` — Playwright HTML report for UI tests
- `ui-allure-report` — Allure report for UI tests
- `ui-failure-screenshots` — Screenshots captured on UI test failure (7 days)

### Live Test Reports

The latest Allure reports are published automatically to GitHub Pages after every run:

**[https://sankariravichandran96-qa.github.io/restful-booker-tests/](https://sankariravichandran96-qa.github.io/restful-booker-tests/)**

| Report | Direct link |
|---|---|
| API Tests | [/api/index.html](https://sankariravichandran96-qa.github.io/restful-booker-tests/api/index.html) |
| UI Tests | [/ui/index.html](https://sankariravichandran96-qa.github.io/restful-booker-tests/ui/index.html) |

### Running the Pipeline Manually

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in the GitHub repository
2. Click **Restful Booker — API & UI Tests** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**
4. All four jobs will execute and results will be available as artifacts within ~5 minutes

### Email Notifications (Optional Setup)

The `notify` job sends an HTML email report after every scheduled run and on any
test failure. To enable it, add the following three secrets under
**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `EMAIL_USERNAME` | Gmail address used to send the report |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Gmail App Password (16-character code from myaccount.google.com → Security → App passwords) |
| `EMAIL_RECIPIENT` | Email address that receives the daily report |

---

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| `BookingClient` wraps all HTTP calls | Tests never call `request.get/post` directly — clean separation of concerns |
| `AuthHelper` caches the token per context | No repeated auth requests — efficient and mirrors real-world SDK patterns |
| `BookingFactory` generates unique names via `Date.now()` | Guaranteed unique data on every run — matches Postman's random data strategy |
| `beforeAll` creates one shared booking for CRUD tests | Tests chain on the same record — mirrors the Postman collection runner approach |
| `afterAll` cleans up test data on every describe | No orphaned records left in the API between runs |
| Page Object Model for all UI interactions | Locators and actions are defined once and reused — changes to the UI only require updates in one place |
| `test.step()` wraps every assertion | Allure shows plain-English steps readable by non-technical stakeholders |
| `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })` on UI suites | UI tests that navigate across steps must run in order |
| `workers: 1` in API config | CRUD tests share booking state — parallel execution would cause race conditions |
| Allure metadata via `allure-js-commons` | Uses the non-deprecated API — `epic()`, `feature()`, `story()`, `severity()` called as plain functions |
| Separate `playwright.api.config.ts` and `playwright.ui.config.ts` | API and UI suites can be run independently with their own base URLs and browser settings |
| All test data in `src/Common/` | Single source of truth — no magic values scattered across test files |

---

## Proposed Improvements

These items were considered but deliberately kept out of scope to avoid over-engineering the assessment solution. They represent natural next steps for a production framework:

- **Tag-based test selection** — Add `@smoke` and `@regression` tags to enable selective CI runs (e.g. `--grep @smoke` for a quick sanity check on every PR, full regression nightly). Tags were omitted here to keep the test signatures clean for readability.
- **Search debounce handling** — `EquitiesSearchPage.searchFor()` uses `waitForTimeout(1500)` to account for the site's search debounce. A more robust approach would intercept the outgoing search request via `page.waitForResponse()` and resolve when the response arrives.
- **Parameterised UI tests** — The four security type tabs (Equities, Funds, ETFs, Bonds) could be driven by a data table to reduce repetition.
- **Visual regression testing** — Screenshot comparisons for the locked fields and banner UI using Playwright's built-in `toHaveScreenshot()`.
- **Retry on flake** — Enable `retries: 2` in CI to auto-retry transient network failures against the live test environments.
- **Parallel UI test execution** — Enable cross-browser runs (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) in CI to catch browser-specific rendering differences earlier.

## Troubleshooting

**`npx allure --version` gives an error**

Allure CLI requires Java 8+. Install from [java.com](https://www.java.com/en/download/) and ensure `java` is on your PATH.

**Tests fail with `Cannot find name 'process'`**

Ensure `@types/node` is installed:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

**UI tests fail with timeout on search results**

The MeDirect site applies a search debounce. If results don't load within the timeout, check your network connection — the page must be reachable at `https://www.medirect.com.mt`.

**Allure report shows stale results from a previous run**

Run `npm run clean` before re-running tests. All `*:allure` scripts do this automatically.

**`Fixture { request } from beforeAll cannot be reused` error**

The API tests use `playwrightRequest.newContext()` inside `beforeAll` instead of the `{ request }` fixture — this is intentional. Do not replace it with the fixture.
